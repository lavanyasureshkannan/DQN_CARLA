# SYSTEM SETUP
## Requirements
---
- Carla Simulator Windows/Ubuntu (This Project was executed in Windows and it is more easier to boot Carla in Win than Ubuntu)
- A virtual environment Load with:
- Python 3.7
- TensorFlow 1.15.0 
- Keras 2.2.4
- Pygame
- Opencv
- TQDM
- Math
---

## Best Practice
**Use Anaconda as your virual environmet/similar**

While creating a new virtual environment using conda create

  **Create environment with tensorflow this will import and install required dependencies especially Numpy and Backend Estimators** 

  > conda create -n your-env-name tensorflow-gpu
  
  > conda activate your-env-name
 
Refer Conda documentation [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/tensorflow/)

---
**Note: Any other Tensorflow or Keras version does not work**

**TensorFlow 1.x has minimal support on Nvidia RTX GPU cards**

# PROCEDURE
## TRAINING THE MODEL
1. Download the carla simulator. 
 - Download [Carla](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/releases)
 - ***This project uses Carla 0.9.5 and was also tested with 0.9.13 (Latest version as of April 2022)***
2. For Windows:
    Run the Carla simulator executable file (.exe)
   For Ubuntu:
    Form terminal run the /.sh
3. Download the python DQN train and model deploy scripts from the Legacy Version directory
4. Paste the two python scripts in 
    > carla_simulator_directory/PythonAPI/examples
5. Open the virtual environment command prompt (here Anaconda prompt)
6. Cd to the carla/PythonAPI/examples directory.
7. To Train the Model type
```
  python train_model.py
```
8. The best trained model will be stored in ../PythonAPI/examples/models directory that gets created when the model starts training.
## DEPLOY TRAINED MODEL

1. To Run the trained model, launch the Carla simulator (if not already launched).
2. cd into the ../models directory and copy the name of the model file you want to deploy.
3. Open the Deploy_DQNmodel.py script that was copied into the ../examples directory earlier and replace the following,
```python
MODEL_PATH = 'MODEL_NAME.model'
```
3. In a new command prompt cd into the ../PythonAPI/examples directory and run  
```
python Deploy_DQNmodel.py
```

This project was heavily inspired by [pythonprogramming.net](https://pythonprogramming.net/introduction-self-driving-autonomous-cars-carla-python/) tutorial.
